# Addressable Atlas Sprites

Directly load sprites from addressable atlases by name!

# Setup

1. Import the package into your project.
2. Create the custom builder assets and add them to your Addressables settings asset.
3. You're good to go!

Once you have the custom builders setup, you can load any sprite contained in an addressable sprite atlas by name.
